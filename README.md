## Setting up Azure Budget

I decided to setup a cost budget with email alerts to avoid unexpected bills caused by resources being left running.

Step 1: Search for "Cost Management" in the Azure portal.

Step 2: Click "Budgets" from the left hand tab.

Step 3: Click "Add" to start the creation if a budget.

Step 4: Create a Budget name, Budget amount and select the Budget scope.

Step 5: Create Alert conditions, for example my budget is Â£100 so I set an alert condition for 50% and 70% which will be emailed to the email address provided.
